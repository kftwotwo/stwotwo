    <h4>Step one is already done!</h4><br>

    <p>We are now one step closer to filling your training needs.</p><br>

    <p>Here’s what’s going to happen next.</p><br>

    <p>After reviewing your request, I will be reaching out to you either via phone or email.</p><br>

    <p>Our first meeting will be focused around your organization and training needs.  We will workout a time for us to meet up for about 30 minutes to review your situation.</p><br>

    <p>And don’t forget, the more the merrier when we meet.  After we arrange the first consult meeting, please feel free to invite any other key players.</p><br>

    <p>I look forward to speaking with you soon!</p><br>

    <p>Best,</p><br>

    <p>Steve Two Two</p>
