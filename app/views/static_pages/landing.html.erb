    <p>All training solutions should be tailored to your learner's needs and interests.   As part of our consult and even in the project I will be asking a lot of questions.  These questions will help me get to the heart of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What you as the leader, would define success of the training.</li>
      <li>What your learners already know, and where their gaps are.</li>
      <li>What your company culture is like, to help bring an organic feel to the training.</li>
